## WDI_SM_21 Project Four
Live Site: https://cover-drive.herokuapp.com/ <br>
Trello: https://trello.com/b/fO5L3lru/project-4-cover-drive

> Cover Drive is an online platform highlighting top YouTube cover artists covering hit songs.


#### How it Works:
Top 10 songs will be aggregated using a Spotify Chart API. User will see the top 10 songs, and clicking on the song will populate objects of relevant your tube covers(artist:name, song:title, thumbnail).  Clicking on the thumbnail will play the YouTUbe Video.
