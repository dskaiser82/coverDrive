# DisCoveree
## WDI_SM_21 Project Four

> Discoveree is an online platform highlighting top YouTube cover artists covering hit songs.
**TEAM MEMBERS:**

#### How it Works:
Top 10 songs will be aggregated using a Spotify Chart API. User will see the top 10 songs, and clicking on the song will populate objects of relevant your tube covers(artist:name, view count, thuumbnail).  Clicking on the thumbnail will play the YouTUbe Video.

Need to be researched:  YouTube API Search URL  =  "[song name] + [artist name] [-performs] + cover""

#### User Stories:
